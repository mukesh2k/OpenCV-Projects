# OpenCV Projects

### This project is created using python with some framewords like mediapipe , OpenCV and pandas

- Do not run any module files because they are just a module which helps to function certain process

## Hand Tracking module

- With the help of OpenCV one can accurately predict the exact position of each fingers using x-y cooridinates. By using this funtion I have created finger counter and volume controller using our finger.

#### FingerCounter

- With a contrast color diffrence our fingers and background, this file function will accurately count the number of fingers that are opened and closed.

#### HandVolumeController

- By adjusting the distance between our thumb and forefinger, one can easily adjust the volume of the system.

## FaceMesh

- Google mediapipe helps us to accurately determine 243 facial points on realtime using our webcam.
- I have used an prerecordered video to track the facial points in this project

## Pose Detection

- By using google mediapipe 43 points of our body can be predicted in x-y coordiates accurately

## Virtual whiteboard

- In this application you can select any two colors or an eraser. For selection we need to open and point our forefinger and middlefinger to our ceiling. Then we can using our forefinger to write anything virtually on the screen. We can erase them or change color by using appropriate options. This is created using opencv and mediapipe.
